React-typescript-redux-mui (rtrm) project starter

After creating two different apps I've taken the common part, creating the web app frame that I (orv anyone else) will be able to start future projects from.

It uses Typescript as my language of choice, react (obvious), redux because I like to have my application state disciplined even if it's small and material UI to achieve universal, standard-looking UI without much individual effort. It's like create-react-app-material-typescript-redux, but simpler.

## Libriaries and dependencies

**rtrm-starter** wouldn't be possible without these great projects:  
React  
Redux  
Material ui  
Create-React-App  
create-react-app-typescript  
create-react-app-material-typescript-redux

Thanks!
